# var-schema

I want to specify a schema for a var that contains a particular type.
Here it is, my over-lunch attempt

## Usage

If I release it on Clojars, it'll be something like:

(require [jessitron/var-schema :as vs]
         [schema.core :as s])

(def VarContainingAString (vs/Var s/String))

(s/defn function-that-accepts-a-var [stringvar :- VarContainingAString]
  (println "I have metadata: " (meta stringvar))
  (println "I contain this string: ->" (deref stringvar) "<-"))
